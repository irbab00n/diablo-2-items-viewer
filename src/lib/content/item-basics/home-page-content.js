module.exports = `<Title>Item Management
Diablo II requires intense item management. You will have to decide what to pick up to take back to sell to the vendors. It's up to you to figure out which items are worth more than others. Keep in mind that non magical items can still be worth a lot of money, especially Wands, Staves, Scepters and Armor. Do some experimentation and create lists of valuable items so you will learn which items to pick up. You can pick up every item you find and sell it but it will take much longer to clear areas. However you do it, it's up to you.

<Title>Emergency Item Space
If you have run out of room in your Backpack, Stash or Horadric Cube, you can squeeze one more 4x2 slot by picking up an item, and leaving it on your mouse pointer. You can exit the game and join another, or just quit the game. The next time you play your character the item will still be on your mouse pointer.

You should not try this if you use an Iron Golem, as it might cause some problems.

<Title>Stackable Items
Some items can be stacked to fit, one on top of the other, in the same inventory slot. Examples include: keys, and all items that can be thrown or shot by a bow - arrows, bolts, throwing knives, javelins, exploding potions, poison potions and such. Stackable items have as part of their property description a quantity (even if the quantity is 1) when highlighted. As you use the item, this number decreases until you have exhausted the stack.
(INSERT EXCERPT ABOUT RUNEWORDS AND LINK TO RUNEWORDS)

You may consolidate stackable items of the same type, like quivers of arrows, by picking up one stack and dropping it onto another stack. The quantities in both stacks are added together to form a new stack. If the resulting stack would exceed the maximum allowable number of stacked items in a slot, any extras will form a separate stack. You cannot un-stack items once they have been stacked. Note that only items that are exactly alike may be stacked. When using ranged weapons, an icon of "crossed arrows" appears on the Play Area whenever your quiver is running low on ammunition.

<Title>What is the general order of rarity of items?
From least rare, to most rare: <low-quality>*Low Quality Items*<low-quality>, <common>*Normal Items*<common>, <superior>*High Quality Items*<superior>, <magic>*Magic Items*<magic>, <rare>*Rare Items*<rare>, <set>*Set Items*<set>, <unique>*Unique Items*<unique>.

Lower Quality items start out being most common but ramp to less common than High Quality depending on the Monster Level (if dropped by a monster) or the Dungeon (Area) Level (if spawned from a chest).

<Title>Items and Gold Disappear after time when left on the ground
Don't leave items or gold lying on the ground any longer than necessary, especially when transferring in town ("muling") as they disappear after a certain amount of time:

10 minutes: Key, Potion, Scroll, Tome, and Ammo (Arrows, Bolts).
10 minutes: Any Armor and Weapon of quality < magic, regardless if flagged as ''Ethereal'', ''Socketed'' or not, and Rune Words.
10 minutes: Pandemonium artifacts (Key of Terror/Hate/Destruction, Mephisto's Brain, Diablo's Horn, Baal's Eye).
10 minutes: Essence (4 flavours) and Token of Absolution (these are new items from Patch 1.13x).
20 minutes: Magic Items, Gems and Runes.
30 minutes: Rare, Set, Unique and Crafted Items.
Picking an item onto your cursor and dropping it again resets the timer.`;
